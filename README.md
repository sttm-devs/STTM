# Simulation To The Metaverse

This project contains the foundational elements of an online VR simulation of a military airbase. Designed with scalability in mind, the project aims to provide an immersive metaverse-style environment where users can simulate realistic airbase operations, complete tasks, and collaborate in multiplayer mode. The primary objective is to enable trainees, such as military personnel and Air Force students, to prepare for real-world scenarios in a safe, risk-free environment.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Realistic Airbase Environment: Includes 3D models of hangars, control towers, runways, maintenance areas, vehicles, and security infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Task and Mission System: Users can create and complete tasks related to maintenance, logistics, security, and air traffic control.</li>
  <li>Multiplayer Functionality: Built using Unity's Netcode for real-time collaboration with other users.</li>
  <li>First-Person VR Controls: Interact with objects, pick up items, and move through the environment seamlessly.</li>
  <li>Scalability: Designed to serve as the foundation for future expansion, supporting advanced features like vehicle operation, dynamic weather conditions, and avatar customization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Unity 3D: Game engine for development.</li>
  <li>C#: Scripting language for tasks, mechanics, and interactions.</li>
  <li>Unity XR: VR integration for Quest headsets.</li>
  <li>Blender: 3D modeling for the environment and objects.</li>
  <li>Unity Gaming Services (UGS): Cloud-based backend services for multiplayer and data synchronization.</li>
</ul>
